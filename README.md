# PID Controller

A C++ implementation of a PID Controller.

PID (Proportional, Integral and Derivative) Controllers are widely used
in control systems in many industries. This project applies the controller
to a self-driving car simulator. It consists of three terms (controls) that
added together gives the next value to apply to the actuator.

This project uses two independent PID controllers for two actuators: the
steering wheel and the throttle.

### Algorithm explanation

**RUBRIC Reflection Criteria 1**
**Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation.**

Each of the three hyperparameters P, I and D control the actuator in three
different ways:

The *P (proportional)* control is the main drive. In the steering wheel it
would try to keep the car as close as possible to the desired path. Small
changes in this value move the car inside or outside the lane.

The *D (derivative)* control predicts future behaviour. If the error rate
increases it accelerate the actuator and viceversa providing stability to
the system. Here it smoothes the car movement canceling the left-right
oscillation.

The *I (integral)* control makes up for the total error (the current
error and all the previous ones). It helps to reach to a zero error
state faster. In this project I found that the values should be
very small. If the value is big it makes the car oscillate again thus
confounding with the effect of the D hyperparameter.


**Animation Results.**

Here is a short recording of the simulation with the last version of
the hyperparameters. The video is an animated GIF that weights 18MB,
it will take a few seconds before it starts to play.

### Final Hyperparameters

**RUBRIC Reflection Criteria 2**
**Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen.**

I tuned the control loop manually. Although there are algorithms available
to do it automatically I prefered to *see* the effect of the parameters and
their interaction. I followed [George Gillard advice](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/_attachments/41330/1493863065/pid_control_document.pdf):

1. Set Kp, Ki,and Kd to 0. This will disable them for now.
2. Increase Kp until the error is fairly small, but it still gets from the beginning to nearly the end quickly enough.
3. Increase Kd until any overshoot you may have is fairly minimal. But be careful with Kd â€“ too much will make it overshoot.
4. Increase Ki until any error that is still existing is eliminated. Start with a really small number for Ki, don't be surprised if it is as small as 0.0001 or even smaller.
5. Change around the constants a little bit to get it working to the best performance.

It was a bit tedious but it seemed to work although the car was unable to finish the track.
My intuition was that the car was accelerating along the race circuit so while the
values were good for the initial race they would be invalid towards the end. ALSO ****** WINDOW.

So I decided to add another PID controller for the thrust. I tried different speeds and
settle to a moderatly slow velocity of 25MPH. I had to tune the hyperparameters again
which proved that the values depend on the speed. The final values for the steering
wheel controller are:

    P == 0.2
    I == 0.00003 (with a 25 slots window)
    D == 1.6

For reference, the throtle controller has PID of 0.1, 0 and 0 respectevily.
